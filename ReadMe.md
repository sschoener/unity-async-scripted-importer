# Async Scripted Importers

This repository contains a little demo project (on Unity 2022.3.44f1) that shows how to use Unity's `AssetDatabaseExperimental` APIs to write asynchronous, on-demand importers.

We convert scriptable objects to json files for this example. In the Unity project, go to `Tools/Trigger Async Imports` to trigger an import and see the result.
